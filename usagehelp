This document provides all necessary infomation required to get started working with GUN.

Place all these files anywhere the path is set to... or in home/username/bin (this directory has default path access)

##  Getting Started  ##
	1. Create a new directory with any name where you want to make your programs. This folder represents your repo at Github.
	2. Enter to that directory.
	3. Now you first need a git repo at the website www.github.com.
	4. Let the URL to your repo be "www.ankurrana.github/Codechef.git"
	5. Now at your local machine run command  "gun init www.ankurrana.github.com/Codechef.git"
	6. The above Command will create neccessary configuration files for controlling and maintaining your gunRepo.
	7. It will create a .GUN folder (hidden) , you can view it by command 'ls -la' or "ctrl+H" in explorer. 

## In order ro create a new program type::
	gun new "nameofprogramwithourquotes" && cd "nameoftheprogramwithoutquotes".

	3. now run subl "nameoftheprogram....cpp"
	4. This will open subl with cpp extension.
	5. Write Code.
